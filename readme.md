# Vema

Vema is a simple CMS. It provides the tools for web development to be only in HTML or MD, to be effective and with minimal maintenance.

Vema does not come to replace heavier tools, nor the multiple options that exist to create static webs. It is just a new approach from Python and with the potential of Flask.

## Features
* Render both HTML and MD
* Build a static web site of your development
* Optimization of your pages and resources
* SEO optimization
* Router generator
* Free and open source software

What feature do you miss or would you like to have?
